## 🌍 Why We Need This in the Modern Age

In today's highly competitive digital landscape, B2B lead generation is often a manual, tedious, and error-prone process. Sales teams spend countless hours scraping directories, validating email addresses, researching company backgrounds, and writing generic outreach emails that result in low conversion rates.

**The AI Lead Generation System** shifts the paradigm. By leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and distributed background processing, this system acts as a persistent, tireless 24/7 sales development representative.

It autonomously:

1. **Discovers** niche local businesses completely organically.
2. **Scrapes & Qualifies** their websites to ensure they match your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).
3. **Personalizes** outreach copy specifically tailored to the prospect's real-world business data.
4. **Executes** the campaign securely with built-in tracking.

## 🚀 Project Overview

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=python,fastapi,postgres,redis,docker,githubactions" alt="Tech Stack" />
</div>

The project is built on a robust, asynchronous tech stack designed to handle high-throughput network operations:

- **Backend API:** `FastAPI` + `Uvicorn` for high-performance RESTful operations.
- **Task Scheduling:** `APScheduler` for lightweight, in-process asynchronous task execution (Optimized for free-tiers).
- **Database:** `PostgreSQL` via `SQLAlchemy (Async)` & `asyncpg` for non-blocking I/O.
- **Scraping Engine:** `Playwright` & `BeautifulSoup4` for deep web crawling.
- **AI Brain:** `Groq API` (Llama 3) for lightning-fast business qualification and personalized email generation.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** `Loguru` for structured logging and `Telegram Bot API` for real-time pipeline notifications.
- **Document Generation:** Auto-populates business-specific `PDF Proposals` and `Excel` daily performance reports.

## ⚙️ Complete System Setup

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 15+ (Local or Cloud e.g., Supabase)
- API Keys for Google Places, Groq, and an SMTP Provider (Brevo/Sendinblue).

### 2. Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the specifics:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Ensure you have set `DATABASE_URL`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, SMTP credentials, Telegram `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, and `IMAP_SERVER` credentials.

### 3. Local Installation (Recommended for Development)

1. **Clone & Environment:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-lead-generation.git
   cd "AI LEAD GENERATION"
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run Database Migrations:**

   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

### Docker Installation (Recommended for Production)

If you prefer an isolated containerized environment, ensure Docker is installed and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will spin up the FastAPI app and (optionally) the PostgreSQL container. All background tasks run seamlessly inside the API process.

---

## 🏃 Running the System

Start the FastAPI Server, which automatically instantiates the APScheduler for background operations:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

> *API Documentation is available at: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)*

---

## 🧪 Automated Testing

We enforce a strict 100% test coverage expectation across the system.
Our End-to-End test suite automatically spins up an asynchronous SQLite memory database (`test.db`) to safely perform operations.

To run the entire suite:

```bash
pytest -v tests/
```

**Testing coverage includes:**

- ✅ Database Schema & ORM capabilities (w/ SQLite compatibility logic for `postgresql.ARRAY`).
- ✅ Discovery Module (Mocks Google API & DOM Scrapers).
- ✅ Asynchronous Task Pipeline validation.
- ✅ System integration & Error handling cases.

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (v2.0)

We are actively planning the next major iteration of the system (V2). Our upcoming goals focus on transforming the platform from a single-channel tool into a fully autonomous, self-learning outreach machine. Key objectives include:

- **Multi-Channel Sequences:** Expanding outreach beyond email to include coordinated, multi-touchpoint sequences (e.g., WhatsApp, SMS, Telegram).
- **Enhanced Lead Discovery:** Integrating multiple new discovery sources to organically find more niche leads, paired with intelligent deduplication logic.
- **Smart AI Inbox & Auto-Replies:** Building an engine to automatically read received replies, classify their intent, and draft context-aware responses.
- **Dynamic Follow-Up Engine:** Replacing single-shot emails with intelligent, multi-step campaigns that auto-pause upon lead engagement.
- **Deep Lead Enrichment:** Gathering comprehensive background data from social channels and wider web presence before outreach to maximize personalization.
- **Self-Improving Analytics:** Implementing automated A/B testing and regular AI-driven reviews to continuously optimize messaging styles and conversion rates.

*(Note: Technical implementation models and architectural choices for these upcoming changes are managed internally).*
